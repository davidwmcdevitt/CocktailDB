# CocktailDB

Before beginning, ensure that Dash is installed in your Python kernel:

`pip install -r requirements.txt `

To launch CocktailDB, clone the repository and run 'app.py.' Once Dash HTML and CORE components have been imported (you should see a progress bar reach 100%), open a web broswer and navigate to the below URL to access the UI:

http://127.0.0.1:8050/

Thank you and happy cocktailing!
